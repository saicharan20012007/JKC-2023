                The Nagarjuna Education Society was formed in 1967 by some educationanists,philanthropists and elders who realised the need for another college in Guntur,as the existing colleges in the city could not cope with the growing demand for higher education among the people of the city and its neighbourhood. Actuated by a sense of moral responsibility towards the younger generation,the Nagarjuna Education Society decided to start a college named after the celebrated philanthropist and patron of learning Sri Jagarlamudi Kuppuswamy Choudary.
